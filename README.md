# Udication: A Divine Framework

## Overview
*Udication*—coined March 03, 2025, by Human Blaze—is a divine framework revealing judgment, creation, and dominion through the Holy Trinity: Yah (Father), Yeshua (Son), and the Holy Spirit ([Deut. 6:4](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%206%3A4&version=NIV), [John 10:30](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2010%3A30&version=NIV)). This repo unites three distinct documents, each a pillar of one narrative—from void to new heaven, guided by faith, hope, and love ([1 Cor. 13:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013%3A13&version=NIV)). Together, they proclaim Yeshua’s reign ([Rev. 19:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2019%3A16&version=NIV)) and our call to steward creation ([Gen. 1:26-28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%201%3A26-28&version=NIV)).

## Background
Born from a disciple’s zeal to unveil His Word ([Matt. 28:19-20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19-20&version=NIV)), this framework bridges scripture’s timeless truth with today’s questions. Crafted in March 2025, it reflects a vision of cosmic order under the Logos ([John 1:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%201%3A1&version=NIV)), offering awe ([Ps. 19:1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2019%3A1&version=NIV)) in a drifting age.

## Story Hint
A sinner, redeemed, pens this work—fueled by love for the King who rose ([Matt. 28:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A6&version=NIV)). It’s a journey from darkness to glory, a whisper of “Come, Lord Jesus” ([Rev. 22:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2022%3A20&version=NIV)), scribed in a fleeting breath—25 generations since His steps ([Luke 3:23-38](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%203%3A23-38&version=NIV)).
